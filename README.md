The following analysis pipelines were used for our study, "Cross-sectional associations between 24-hour time-use
composition, grey matter volume and cognitive function in healthy older adults" (currently published as a preprint:
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.15.23289982v1).

Increasing physical activity (PA) is an effective strategy to slow reductions in cortical volume and maintain
cognitive function in older adulthood. However, PA does not exist in isolation, but coexists with sleep and 
sedentary behaviour to make up the 24-hour day. We investigated how the balance of all three behaviours 
(24-hour time-use composition) is associated with grey matter volume in healthy older adults, and whether 
grey matter volume influences the relationship between 24-hour time-use composition and cognitive function.
